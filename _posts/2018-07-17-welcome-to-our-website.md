## Website Launch

The Cancer Systems Biology Laboratory is launching a new GitHub Pages website. This will be the first place to look for up-to-date information about the lab's activities and news. New opportunities to be a part of the group will be published here, as well as details about new publications and software tools. If you haven't already, check out the [GitHub profile of the Cancer Systems Biology Laboratory](https://github.com/ciccalab).
