## Software Projects
We have developed several software tools for analysis of genetic alterations that occur in cancer.

### MEGA-V
[Mutation Enrichment Gene set Analysis of Variants (MEGA-V)](https://github.com/ciccalab/MEGA "MEGA-V source code on GitHub") is an open-source R application with a Shiny web interface. It identifies gene sets with a significantly higher number of variants in a cohort of interest (cohort A) as compared to (1) a control cohort (cohort B) or (2) a random distribution generated using Monte Carlo.

### NCG
[Network of Cancer Genes (NCG)](http://ncg.kcl.ac.uk) is a publicly available manually-curated repository of cancer genes and associated properties from cancer mutational screenings.

### sysSVM
systems-level Support Vector Machine (sysSVM) - Details to follow.
